    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "With the explosive market growth for electric vehicles (EVs) and charging system’s development, driving electric has become a popular trend. However, a huge leap that prevents everyone from buying an EV would be its arised difficulties, specifically vehicle mileage restrictions, charging station density distribution between suburbs and cities, and battery capacity. Due to these issues, most households may prefer owning a gas vehicle for contemporary use. In the scope of this project, we would like to predict the availability of vehicle charging stations from inputs, such as maximum mileage, starting location and destination, and EV charging brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is quantifiable and measurable in the sense of converting the distance of the nearest and optimal charging station into probability estimates from classification algorithms. Some charging sites can vary its charging time and cost; in the scenario the model yields multiple charging stations, we could rely on a decision tree model to greedily pick the optimal station. Metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve, will be used to measure the performance of the algorithms and models. Road trip planning is a recurring in many lives; therefore, we would like to generalize our solution for all EV drivers. Since the dataset we are using continually updates fueling station locations in the United States, our solution would generalize over time as well."
